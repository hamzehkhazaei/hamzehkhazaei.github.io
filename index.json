In the system reliability module, we will examine the similarities and differences between reliability engineering for hardware systems and for software systems, and techniques for achieving software reliability. Software fault tolerance mechanisms will be the main focus. In the computer security module, we will examine the potential threats to computer system security, and controls for protecting computer systems against both malicious and non-malicious compromise. By its nature, computer security extends beyond the domain of software, and encompasses the entire environment in which a computer system is embedded. Therefore, this module will examine both software and non-software threats and controls.\n","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4977aba345a8e7f03ca2d2661a3f971f","permalink":"https://hamzehkhazaei.github.io/teaching/ece422/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/ece422/","section":"teaching","summary":"Reliable and Secure Systems Design","tags":["UofA","undergrad"],"title":"ECE422","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this course, we investigate dependability attributes including performance, reliability, availability, fault tolerance, security, maintainability and operation of distributed systems.

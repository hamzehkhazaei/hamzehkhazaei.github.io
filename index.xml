      <description>&lt;p&gt;This course discusses the fundamental data structures commonly used in the design of algorithms.
At the end of this course, students will know the classical data structures, and master the use of abstraction,
specification and program construction using modules. Furthermore, students will be able to apply these skills
effectively in the design and implementation of algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This course is intended to teach students the fundamental concepts that underlie operating systems, including
multiprogramming, concurrent processes, CPU scheduling, deadlocks, memory management, file systems, protection and
security. Many examples from real systems are given to illustrate the application of particular concepts. At the end of
this course, a student will be able to understand the principles and techniques required for understanding and designing
operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming Soon.&lt;br&gt;
This is an introductory course in Distributed Systems. Distributed systems is the study of how to build a computer
system where the state of the program is divided over more than one machine (or &amp;ldquo;node&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming Soon.&lt;br&gt;
In distributed systems, one can choose from a variety of load balancing policies, a wide range of migration policies,
capacity provisioning schemes, power management policies, etc. Ideally, one would like to have answers to these questions
before investing the time and money to build a system. This course introduces students to stochastic and queuing
modeling to answer the above questions.&lt;/p&gt;
